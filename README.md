Our product serves to effectively provide college students with internships offered at various companies.
We believe that current employement systems such as indeed 
fail to provide sufficient internship opportunities that cater to students'
preferences. Another challenge we identified is that attaining an intership at 
big companies is extremely challenging, whereas only a handful of interns are selected 
and a significant amount are deemed unfit. Thus, iCIMS serves as a platform, or home rather,
for internships. Based on the user's preferences and skills, it makes a vast amount internships readily available to
you. Using iCIMS, you are undoubtedly assured to attain an internship.
