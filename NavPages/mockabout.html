    <p> Our product serves to effectively provide college students with internships offered at various companies. 
    We believe that current employement systems such as indeed fail to provide sufficient internship opportunities 
    that cater to students' preferences. Another challenge we identified is that attaining an intership at big 
    companies is extremely challenging, whereas only a handful of interns are selected and a significant amount are
    deemed unfit. Thus, iCIMS serves as a platform, or home rather, for internships. Based on the user's preferences
    and skills, it makes a vast amount internships readily available to you. Using iCIMS, you are undoubtedly
    assured to attain an internship. </p>
